# OSX-ish GNOME Shell Theme

A GNOME Shell theme made to take aesthetics from OSX without being a straight rip-off. There is an install script included with this to piece together the theme and get everything going for you.

The install script is untested in it's current state, but it should be fine to run. If you would like to be safe, just open the script and run the bash commands individually (read and understand what they are doing first though).

I made this for myself so I'm not putting much more time in it more than I need to. If anyone is interested in this theme, let me know and I can put more into it to get everything polished up.

### Pieces that make the whole of this theme

* La Capitaine icon theme
* Paullinuxthemer's Mc-OS themes
* Sierra-gtk themes
* Pexel pictures for the wallpapers
* Lato font family
